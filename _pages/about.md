Hello! My name is Guillermo Beck Villarroel, and I am currently a PhD candidate at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. I hold a Master's Degree in Sociology from the same university and work as a researcher at the Agencia de Calidad de la Educación. My research interests focus on studying attitudes toward social inequality and education, with a particular emphasis on quantitative methods.

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy playing bass, riding my bike, playing football, and spending time with my family and friends. You can find my work and detailed research projects on this site. Thank you for visiting!

PhD Proposal
------
My research focuses on understanding redistributive preferences in Chile. The proposal explores how various factors, such as social identity, perceived inequality, and fairness, shape these preferences. The study includes three main components: analyzing changes in redistributive preferences over time in Chile, examining the role of social structures (e.g., homophily and consolidation), and investigating the impact of relative deprivation and fairness perceptions on attitudes towards redistribution. This research seeks to provide a nuanced understanding of the determinants of redistributive preferences in a highly unequal society.


At my job
------
In my work, I focus on studying how various factors influence school and student outcomes. Currently, I am researching the impact of school composition in terms of socioeconomic status (SES), maternal education, gender, and race on academic achievement and coexistence in Chilean schools. The primary goal of this study is to understand how structural patterns within schools are associated with these outcomes.


Methods
======
Social Network Analysis, Structural Equation Modeling, Causal Inference.
